# Barbearia Alura

This repository contains the source code for the fictional Barbearia Alura website, a static website built as part of my formation in [BoticÃ¡rio's Programa Desenvolve 2023](https://desenvolve.grupoboticario.com.br/). The website applies HTML and CSS concepts learned from Alura's HTML5 course to create a landing page with two sub-pages: products and contact. Please note that Barbearia Alura is a fictional barbershop and this website is for educational purposes only.
